📌 Milestone 3 – Model Training
Objective

To train a baseline CNN model for classifying document images as Official or Wiki based on visual features.

Dataset Used

Two classes: Official scans and Wiki scans

Dataset split:

80% Training

20% Validation

Images resized to 224 × 224

(Dataset not uploaded to GitHub due to large size)

Preprocessing

Image rescaling (1/255)

Data augmentation on training data:

Rotation

Zoom

Horizontal flip

Validation data only rescaled

Model Description

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Layers used:

Conv2D + ReLU

MaxPooling

Flatten

Dense

Dropout

Sigmoid output layer

Binary classification (Official vs Wiki)
