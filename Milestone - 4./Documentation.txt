# Milestone 4 – Deployment & Final Documentation
## AI TraceFinder: Scanner Image Verification System

---

## 1. Introduction
Milestone 4 focuses on deploying the trained deep learning model through a user-friendly web interface. The system allows users to upload scanned document images and receive predictions along with confidence scores. All predictions are logged and made downloadable.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Deploy trained CNN model
- Build UI for image upload
- Display prediction and confidence score
- Store prediction logs
- Test the system with sample images
- Document results with screenshots

---

## 3. Software & Tools Used
- Python 3.11
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pandas
- PIL
- VS Code
- Google Colab

---

## 4. System Architecture
1. User uploads scanned image
2. Image preprocessing (resize & normalization)
3. Model inference using trained CNN
4. Prediction and confidence generation
5. Display results on UI
6. Save prediction in CSV log

---

## 5. Deployment Process
The application is deployed locally using Streamlit.

### Steps:
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run application:
python -m streamlit run app.py
3. Access UI via browser:
http://localhost:8501

---

## 6. Model Used
- CNN model trained in previous milestones
- Input size: 224 × 224 × 3
- Output: Binary classification
- Model file: `tracefinder_model.h5`

---

## 7. Testing Details
Three test images were used:
- test1.png
- test2.png
- test3.png

Each image was successfully classified, and confidence scores were generated.

---

## 8. Prediction Log
- Predictions are stored in `prediction_log.csv`
- Fields include:
- Timestamp
- Image Name
- Prediction Label
- Confidence Score

---

## 9. Screenshots Included
The `result_screenshots` folder contains:
- Model loading confirmation
- Streamlit UI
- Uploaded image preview
- Prediction & confidence output
- VS Code terminal execution

---

## 10. Limitations
- Model file size is large and may exceed GitHub limits
- Deployment is local (not cloud-hosted)

---

## 11. Conclusion
Milestone 4 objectives were successfully achieved. The model was deployed using Streamlit, predictions were logged, and results were properly documented with screenshots.
